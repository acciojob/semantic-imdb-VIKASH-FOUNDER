	<Summary>
    <p>Stree is about to re-enter Chanderi, where she notices a statue of herself at the town entrance built by the townspeople as a sign of respect with the inscription, O Stree Raksha Karna (transl. Oh Woman Protect us), and chooses to leave Chanderi.[b]
     <br>
     <br>
    Years later, Chanderi faces a new threat in the form of Sarkata, a headless ghost, who abducts women at night and drags them into a nightmarish alternate dimension. The townspeople, unaware of the ghost's presence, mistakenly believe the missing women have left for better prospects. Vicky, still in love with the unnamed girl, frequently imagines her appearing before him. Meanwhile, Rudra receives an anonymous letter containing missing pages from the Chanderi Puran and a cryptic message Vo Aayega (transl.He will come). A concerned Rudra warns Vicky about it, but is dismissed.
